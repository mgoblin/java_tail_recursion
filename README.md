# Example of java tail recursion calls support

This work is based on Vinisha Sharma's blog post

## Recursion calls problem
Recursion is function's to call of itself.
Recursion is widely known concept in a
functional programming design. 
Each function's call allocate stack frame. 
Therefore, we have limited by the size of stack
